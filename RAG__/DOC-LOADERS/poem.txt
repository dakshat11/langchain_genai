In fields of green, the players stand,
With bat and ball in hand,
The sun shines down, the crowds erupt,
As bowlers run their grand.

The leather flies, the stumps they crash,
As runs are scored with glee,
The sound of cheers and clapping hands,
Echo through the trees.

With skill and grace, they play the game,
With passion in their eyes,
Each player stands to face the test,
And reach for glory's prize.

The competition fierce and strong,
The battle rages on,
As batsmen swing and bowlers pitch,
The game of cricket's won.

So let us cheer for cricket's stars,
The heroes of the game,
As they take their place on the field,
And etch their names in fame.
